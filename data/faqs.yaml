    -   question: What is an &quot;Antumbra&quot;?
        answer: >
            The word &quot;Antumbra&quot; means the region from which an occluding body appears
            entirely contained within the disc of a light
            source - like a solar eclipse.
    -   question: What is Glow?
        answer: >
            Antumbra | Glow is a small
            light emitting device, designed to enhance your
            work and entertainment experience while reducing
            eye strain.  Simply mount it behind your monitor,
            point it at a wall, plug in the included micro-USB
            cable and start the Glow software.
    -   question: Who is Glow for?
        answer: >
            Anyone can benefit from
            Glow - however, people who use their
            computer in low light environments will enjoy
            it most.  Games, movies, and even work are
            all better with Glow.
    -   question: How does this affect my computing experience?
        answer: >
            Glow can be controlled
            any way you like. You can manually set its
            color (16 million discrete values), or allow
            it to react dynamically to the content on
            your screen. We will be launching an Extension
            Store for Glow that will allow users to easily
            download extended functionality. In addition,
            we're an open-source project,
            so if there&apos;s a missing feature you want,
            feel free to implement it. If we like it
            enough, we may just add it to the official
            release.
    -   question: How does Glow work?
        answer: >
            Glow is connected to your computer via a
            Micro-USB cable. This connection provides
            both power and data, allowing you to manipulate
            your Glow from the Antumbra application.
    -   question: How does this effect reduce eyestrain?
        answer: >
            Ambient backlighting creates a seamless transition
            from your bright display to dark environment.
            In doing so the light object you&apos;re looking at
            (your monitor) is extended into your peripherals.

    -   question: How does Glow connect to my monitor?
        answer: >
            Glow mounts behind your monitor (or to
            almost any surface you&apos;d like) using 3M
            Dual-Lock, a super strong plastic &quot;velcro&quot;.
            We are also developing a clip-on stand for
            laptop users, but we don&apos;t expect to ship it
            with beta.  Right now, Antumbra is best suited
            for users with desktop monitors (15 to 30
            inches diagonal) that are placed anywhere from
            one to three feet from a wall.
            Results may vary in other configurations.
    -   question: How does this help my eyes?
        answer: >
            By illuminating the wall behind a computer
            monitor or TV, the contrast between the
            display and the rest of the room is
            reduced - making long sessions of both work
            and play more comfortable.  Your eyes are
            meant to look at light reflecting off of
            objects, not the light source itself.  By
            introducing more light into a dark room,
            your pupils constrict and limit the amount
            of light from the monitor that enters your
            eyes, preventing eye strain caused by staring
            at a (relatively small) bright source of light.
            In addition, more constricted pupils allow
            the screen to go from dark to bright quickly
            without causing discomfort - a common issue
            when watching many movies and videogames.
            Colors, brightness and responsive modes can
            all be set in software, allowing you to
            create the perfect experience for any task.

    -   question: Are there any system requirements?
        answer: >
            In order to control Glow, you will need to
            be able to run one of the controller
            applications.  We currently offer software
            for Mac OS X 10.7, 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10, Windows
            Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 / 8.1, as well
            as Linux (command-line interface only). However, if
            you would like to see support for a different
            platform, just shoot us an email!  In addition
            to this, your computer must have one powered
            USB port (USB 2.0 or better).
    -   question: Is Glow customizable?
        answer: >
            Yes. Glow is open-source software <b>and</b> hardware.
            Aside from the customizability offered by
            default (such as choosing colors, fades and
            responsive modes), developers, engineers,
            hackers and makers can add and implement
            whatever new features they want. The
            possibilities are endless!
    -   question: What does &apos;beta&apos; mean?
        answer: >
            Glow is still in development.  Although all
            the hardware and software is complete, fully
            functional and very reliable, we need to
            ensure that everything works absolutely
            perfectly for every user before we move into
            large-scale production.  Beta allows us to
            test that, gather user feedback for additional
            features, and tackle any bugs that might arise.
            Beta units are offered without warranty and
            are not guaranteed be perfect - so we advise
            that users who aren&apos;t comfortable solving
            computer problems hold off until the official
            product launch.  If you like being on the
            cutting edge and getting your hands dirty
            with open-source products, Beta is perfect for you.
    -   question: When do you ship?
        answer: >
            You can find the most up to date info about our upcoming / past
            events on the <a class="redOnHover" href="/blog/">
            dev blog / roadmap</a>.
    -   question: So you&apos;re open-source?
        answer: >
            Completely.  We&apos;re releasing all our code,
            all the hardware designs, and even the code
            for this website.  Feel free to use anything
            for commercial purposes or otherwise, just
            attribute the original work to us and link
            to our site.  We&apos;re not pursuing any patents
            and are excited to see what the open-source
            community will contribute.  Hardware will be
            released under Creative Commons Attribution
            Share-Alike Non-Commercial, and all software will be released under GPL.
    -   question: What are your plans for the future?
        answer: >
            We&apos;ve had an overwhelming interest for a Glow
            implementation for TV&apos;s so we are looking into
            different solutions including streaming devices, and
            open-source content platforms. We also have plans to
            take our technology to other lighting applications
            including customizable, controllable, and
            extendable ambient lighting. If you have another idea
            on some cool way to use this technology
            shoot us an email at contact@antumbra.io.
